-The Kinh and all ethnic minorities in Vietnam have a time-honoured tradition of music and dance. This is evidenced by the figures seen dancing to music which were engraved on the bronze drums unearthed at Dong Son (Thanh Hoa province) and lithophones discovered in Tay Nguyen Highlands and other relics. Besides royal court music, there was also a rich vein of music which was closely attached to the daily lives of the working masses. Thousands of diverse musical tunes have been collected from this source. From Quan Ho folk songs in the North to Hue songs (songs from the Perfume River), "guessing game" songs, satirical songs, joking songs and numerous songs in southern provinces, all are characterised by a profound sensibility and poetic, lyrical sense. After 1945, royal court music was underdeveloped. But folk music flourished more than ever before along with the increasingly popular modern music

-Quy Nhon, provincial capital of Binh Dinh, is 1,065km from Ha Noi on National Highway 1. In the old days, Quy Nhon was called Thi Nai, the name of a beautiful lake inside the city. Bien Quy Nhon (Quy Nhon+Sea) has an annual average temperature of 25.7oC and is suitable for tourism the year round. Hoang Hau Beach is an ideal place for bathing. Quang Trung Museum is dedicated to Nguyen Hue, a national hero of the 18th century. It was built in his native land of Kien My village, Binh Thanh commune, Tay Son district, some 45km from Quy Nhon City. Nguyen Hue is one of three brothers who led the Tay Son Insurrection. In 1788, he led a great force advancing from Phu Xuan (Hue) to the North. It took 35 days and they exacted an overwhelming defeat on the Qing invaders near Thang Long (now Ha Noi), thereby liberating the royal+capital. He crowned himself Emperor Quang Trung the same year. At Quang Trung Museum, visitors will enjoy music and demonstrations of Vo Tay Son (traditional martial arts of Binh Dinh). In particular, they can+see a young woman, a niece of the 9th generation of Emperor Quang Trung, playing 11 battle drums. In addition, Hoi Van village (Cat Trinh commune, Phu Cat district) is well known for its hot spring. It is composed of+various chemical components useful in the treatment of rheumatism, mental disorder, cardio-vascular diseases and skin diseases. Beside the hot spring, there is a sanatorium which offers steam baths with mineral water of 38oC useful for medical treatment and general health improvement.=Built in 1665 in the Do Ban Citadel -second capital of the Kingdom of Cham Pa some 27km from Quy Nhon City -Thap Thap Pagoda is a Buddhist temple, but its decorations are characterized by the Cham decorative art. Duong Long Cham Tower is also called Thap Nga (Tower of Ivory),+consisting of three towers. This group of towers is one of the most beautiful in Central Vietnam.

-There are several kinds of Buoi (pomelo) regionally famous for their taste, and each of them is named after the locality where it is grown (Buoi Bien Hoa, Buoi Phuc Trach, Buoi Thuan Hai, for example). Buoi duong Phuc Trach (Phuc Trach sweet pomelo) has been famous widely in the country after it was awarded a medal at a national fruit fair organised in 1938. The Far East Economic Review remarked: "In Vietnam's central coast, there is a particularly delicious pomelo. Kept after a while, the juice in the pomelo segments becomes muddy as if it is some sort of sugar itself. You can try the fruit as much as you can"

-Ca Tru -an original art performance of academic character -has been preserved for the past 10 centuries.To appreciate Ca Tru is to appreciate poetry and music. Ca Tru appeared officially under Nha Hau Ly (11th century). First, it served royal and religious rituals and was called Hat Khuon. Later, it was used in banquets, weddings, friendly meetings... and called Hat Hang Hoa Ca Tru had bamboo castanets as principal+instrument. By beating time on tomtoms, spectators accompanied and praised the singer. Ca Tru was also called Hat Nha Tro (singing or dancing while pulling funny tricks), Hat Thuong (Singing to be rewarded by king or mandarins), Hat Cua Quyen (singing in royal palaces), Hat Cua Dinh (singing for religious rituals), Hat a dao (name of a famous songstress in the Ly times).... Under the French domination, Ca Tru declined. Nowadays, it is restored as a type of original popular art

-What is a Ca Tru declamation? Originally, Ca Tru was like cheo singing and served at ceremonies and festivals in the northern delta. When these ceremonies and festivals were no longer held, Ca Tru became a type of chamber music serving as intellectual food for those who would like to enjoy music and poetry

-Music and poetry are the basis of Ca Tru and decide which ensemble of principal instruments, musicians and subordinate instruments should provide the accompaniment. Ca Tru has many melodies that are sung differently, but the chief is singing-reciting: A singer and a musician playing a long-necked lute-like instrument. Also taking part is a member of the audience who expresses his appreciation and response by beating a drum. A rather special description fits the songstress of former days: "Fine clothes, velvet turban, delicate bobtailed hair, a moon-shaped face, knife-sharp eyes, refined manners, with sweet words, mild as flowers, transparent as snow, her beauty and charm are second only to Kim Van Kieu's..." To perform as expected, the+singer must practise very hard and know many tunes. A male musician accompanies the singer. He too practises hard so as to be in perfect harmony with the singer. The music accompaniment consists of a "phach" -a bamboo instrument beaten with two wooden sticks -and "trong chau" -a drum beaten by a member of the audience in appreciation or comment. Of course, this member of the audience is very experienced at beating the drum -a single beat, three or five successive beats and nine beats at the climax to be "in tune" with the lute. A timely response by the drummer encourages the singer who knows that she has met someone who both understands and appreciates her talent. These three instruments: The lute, the "phach" and the "trong chau" are inseparable. Being a subordinate+instrument, the drum is essential as a bridge between the performer and audience. The harmonious combination of the lute, the "phach" and the+human voice makes it a perfect performance as praised in these lines by Vu Hoang Chuong: Sweet phach, passionate lute mild smoke cushion. The sad voice lingers on in the middle of night. To enjoy Ca Tru is to enjoy both music and singing. The art of Ca Tru is both high and original. Its sound range originates from that of the lullaby in the Red River delta. Ca Tru -with water puppetry -is+indigenous to Vietnam. It is a valuable legacy for Vietnamese culture

-Many talented poets like Chu Manh Trinh, Nguyen Cong Tru, Tu Xuong, Duong Khue and Tan Da composed excellent tunes, extraordinarily pure and high-falutin to charm the audience.+At the beginning of the 20th century, before the 1945, there were many places where Ca Tru was performed: Kham Thien, Bo De, Lo Khe (Hanoi); Quan Ba Mau, Quynh Cu (Hai Phong) and throughout Bac Ninh, Hai Duong and Nam Dinh provinces. But then, Ca Tru became Co Dau -performed by a sing-song girl or type of geisha. The art of Ca Tru was forgotten because it was thought to be a product of the ruling+class; the singers whores and the audience no more than hedonists. Singers abandoned their careers because of this bias and inhabitants of the Kham Thien area even left their homes because of it. Before 1976, musician Nguyen Xuan Khoat was the only Vietnamese musicologist to study Ca Tru. Ca Tru artists are still rare now, but attention is being given their art. Lo Khe village, Phu Do (in Ha Noi) is considered the cradle of Ca Tru and on the 6th of the 4th lunar month and the 13th of the tenth lunar month each year, members of the Ca Tru circle hold initiator-worshipping celebrations Artists young and old sing the Ca Tru, always beginning with two pieces: Non Mai and Hong Hanh.+The artist who deserves most praise for the revival and world-wide spread of Ca Tru is Doctor-Professor Tran Van Khe He has recorded Ca Tru, Quan Ho and cheo songs and declamations and sent them to France for the UNESCO Musical Committee to study. As a result, many recordings of Ca Tru and Quan Ho songs have been made. The support of eminent artist Quach Thi Ho has made the recordings a great success. All the original features of Ca Tru are prominent, and Ho was evaluated by the Musical+Committee and awarded with an honorary commendation with these lines: "We thank you for your contribution to the keeping of an original, traditional art legacy of Vietnam and an exceptional delicacy of mankind". Since then, Vietnam has sent a delegation to an Asian tribute held in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea where Ho^`'s recordings were among the most honoured. A Ca Tru club has been established in Ha Noi, a place for all of Vietnam's excellent Ca Tru artists. It not only revives an old+musical form but attracts foreign musicologists: American, English, German and Japanese. American researcher Mirada Krenzen has written a persuasive study, Vietnam's Traditional Music Process. It was presented at a seminar to discuss Vietnam's traditional music in Ha Noi in 1994. Krenzen possesses a deep knowledge of Ca Tru and has gained the admiration of Vietnamese musicologists. She wrote: "Ca Tru seems to have a magic power, a fermented substance to charm the listeners. Once I understood Ca Tru, I understood the Vietnamese people better". It is possible that Ca Tru is a patch of the Vietnamese soul that Krenzen has understood? ()
